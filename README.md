## 👨‍💻 About Me  

I’m a full-stack developer with a strong product mindset and over three years of experience turning ideas into real, production-ready applications.  

I’ve worked in **startup environments**, **software companies**, and as a **lecturer**, which helped me develop not only strong technical skills, but also the ability to communicate clearly, ship fast, and think about business value—not just code.

I love:
- Designing clean, predictable architectures  
- Keeping UX smooth and fast  
- Automating everything that can (and should) be automated
